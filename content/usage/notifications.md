# Overview

Drone does not have built-in notification capabilities. Instead notifications are delegated to plugins. This section of the documentation provides a high level overview of notifications and should be used in conjunction with the respective plugin documentation.

Example Slack notification using the Slack plugin:

```yaml
pipeline:
  build:
    image: node
    commands:
      - npm install
      - npm run build
      - npm run tests

  slack:
    image: plugins/slack
    channel: dev
    username: drone
```

# Templates

Many notification plugins support [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates for customizing notification messages. This example demonstrates a custom slack message:

```yaml
pipeline:
  slack:
    image: plugins/slack
    channel: dev
    username: drone
    template: |
      {{repo.name}} finished build {{build.number}}
      with a status of {{build.status}}
```

Example template that generates a different message based on build status:

```yaml
pipeline:
  slack:
    image: plugins/slack
    channel: dev
    username: drone
    template: |
      {{#success build.status}}
        {{build.author}} successfully pushed to {{build.branch}}
      {{else}}
        {{build.author}} broke the build. Hang your head in shame.
      {{/success}}
```

# Template Variables

# Template Builtins

Drone includes a number of builtin handlebars functions to help format your messages. This is an example builtin function that converts a string to all uppercase characters:

```handlebars
{{uppercase build.status}}
```

Converts a string to all lowercase characters:

```handlebars
{{lowercase build.author.name}}
```

Truncates a string to N characters:

```handlebars
{{truncate build.commit 8}}
```

Calculates a duration and returns a human readable string:

```handlebars
{{duration build.started build.finished}}
```

Converts a timestamp to a human readable string:

```handlebars
finished at {{datetime build.finished "3:04PM" "UTC"}}
```

Returns true if the build is successful:

```handlebars
{{#success build.status}}
  It works
{{/success}}
```

Returns true if the build failed:

```handlebars
{{#failure build.status}}
  Something is busted
{{/failure}}
```
